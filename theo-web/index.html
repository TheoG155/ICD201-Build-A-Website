			<p>
				In <b>October 2024</b>, I was part of the sailing team competing in the <b>J/80 North American Championships</b> held at the <b>National Yacht Club</b> in <b>Toronto, Ontario</b>. Our boat, a <b>J/80</b> named <b>Alchemist</b>, had been with us for only a couple of months, and with just a few practice sessions under our belts, we entered our first one-design regatta. Our crew consisted of <em>Theo Goncalves</em>, <em>Jason Goncalves</em>,  <em>Matt Vetter</em>, and <em>Stefan Heemsoth</em>, who stepped in for our usual teammate <em>Lukas Heemsoth</em>. We're now focused on honing our skills for the upcoming sailing season, aiming to participate in the <b>J/80 World Championships in Kingston, Ontario, in 2026</b>.

		<h2>What is a J/80?</h2>
			<p>
				The <b>J/80</b> is a <em>26-foot one-design sportboat</em> renowned for its speed, stability, and ease of handling. Designed by <b>J/Boats</b>, it features a <b>fixed keel</b>, a spacious <b>open cockpit</b>, and a <b>large asymmetrical spinnaker</b> for downwind performance. The one-design aspect ensures that all boats are built to identical specifications, emphasizing the sailors' skills and teamwork over technological advantages.

		<h2>Our Performance</h2>
			<p>
				In a fleet of 30 boats, we secured <b>27th place</b>. Given that it was our inaugural regatta with limited preparation, our primary goal was to avoid finishing lastâ€”a goal we successfully achieved. The experience provided invaluable lessons in sail trim, race strategy, and teamwork, fueling our enthusiasm for future competitions.
